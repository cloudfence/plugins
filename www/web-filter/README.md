## OPNsense Web Filter plugin

The main idea of plugin is to make possible a true Web Proxy control with capabilities that isn't (yet) available existing options to OPNsense.

### Features:
- User based rules;
- Block websites based on categories;
- Custom block pages;
- RegEx based rules;

The community version source code is available in this repository. This effort is to try to help the OPNsense community to evolve the project in some way.

Feel free to improve it and share it!
